# Depression and Suicide Analysis Using Machine Learning and NLP
Depression data analysis:
Used Machine learning and NLP to understand how to predict posts that indicate depression in people and their accuracy. For this work, we have used a dataset from reddit. We used NLP to gain a better understanding of interdisciplinary fields which are related to suicide.We discovered two help groups for depression and suicidal thoughts: r/depression and r/SuicideWatch. The famous "SuicideWatch" subreddit is commonly used by people who have thoughts of suicide and gives significant signals for suicidal behavior.We have used multiple ML algorithms such as Na√Øve Bayes, SVM , Logistic Regression , Random Forest .
